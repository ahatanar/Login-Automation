# Login-Automation
Automatically Login to school meets and classes.
I developed this program to automatically log into my google meets and classes as sometimes i was not available, at work, or i just forgot, so I used selenium Webdriver and created a program in Java to automatically log me into all my classes.
After creating the executable programs, I needed a way to execute the file in task manager, so i created batch files of all programs and then scheduled them at class times to automatically run, therefore signing me in.
